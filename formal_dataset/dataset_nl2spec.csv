Every a is eventually followed by a e.
It is never the case that a and b hold at the same time.
"Whenever a is enabled, b is enabled three steps later."
"e must hold everywhere until from some point on, d holds infinitely often."
"If b holds at some point, a has to hold somewhere beforehand."
"Whenever a holds, b holds as well."
Both a and b hold in every time step.
"a holds always and whenever b holds, c does not hold."
"If it is the case that every a is eventually followed by a b, then c needs to holds infinitely often."
"If a holds infinitely often, then b holds infinitely often as well."
Either a or b holds infinitely often
a never holds from some point in time on.
"Whenever a and b do not hold, c holds eventually."
a and b never occur at the same time but one of them holds in every time step.
"Whenever the inputs a and b are the same, the outputs c and d are the same."
a can only happen if b happend before
"Once a happened, b will not happen again."
a releases b
a and b will not occur at the same time
"Whenever a holds and b holds in the next step, then c holds one step after b."
"Whenever a holds, b holds eventually from the next step on."
a holds in every fifth step.
Either a holds infinitely often or b holds in the next step.
a will hold at all instances.
"Whenever a holds, b must hold in the next two steps"
"One of the following aps will hold at all instances: a,b,c"
If a holds b will eventually hold
"a must always hold, but if is execeeds, it allow two timestamps to recover."
not a holds at most two timestamps
a can only hold every three timestamps
Every a is followed by a b.
Eventually a and b hold.
Both a and b hold eventually.
It is always the case that a is the same as b in the next step.
"If b holds then, in the next step, c holds until a holds or always c holds"
a holds until b holds or always a holds
